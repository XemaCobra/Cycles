Install
=======

Get the code
------------

Cycles is open source, and the code is `available on github`_. There is no demo
project for now, files for Cycles can be found in the `source folder`_.

.. _`available on github`: https://github.com/weipin/Cycles
.. _`source folder`: https://github.com/weipin/Cycles/tree/master/source

Install manually
----------------

Cycles hasn't been packaged as frameworks for now. You will have to add the
source files to your own project to use Cycles.

* Add all files in the "source" folder to your project.
